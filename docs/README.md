Plants can add life and magic to your desk, but growing them can be difficult, so let's add some virtual plants instead...

Plantstellation is an AR toy for arranging plants. The mobile app and markers can be downloaded [here](http://pointyteeth.github.io/plantstellation).

Plantstellation was built with [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) and uses [Vuforia](https://www.vuforia.com/) for AR.

I learned basic shader programming with [this tutorial series from Alan Zucconi](http://www.alanzucconi.com/2015/06/10/a-gentle-introduction-to-shaders-in-unity3d/), and I learned about ramp shading and outline shading from [this tutorial from Lindsey Reid](https://lindseyreidblog.wordpress.com/2017/12/19/cel-shader-with-outline-in-unity/) and [Wikibooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Cg_Programming/Unity/Toon_Shading).

While making this app, I actually did start growing some real plants. Some are thriving and some have passed on. ðŸ’–
